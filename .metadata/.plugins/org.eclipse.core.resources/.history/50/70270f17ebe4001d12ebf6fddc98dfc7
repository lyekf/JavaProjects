/**
Here, we instantiate two Salary objects. One using a Salary reference s, and the other using an Employee reference e.

While invoking s.mailCheck(), the compiler sees mailCheck() in the Salary class at compile time, and the JVM invokes mailCheck() in the Salary class at run time.

mailCheck() on e is quite different because e is an Employee reference. When the compiler sees e.mailCheck(), the compiler sees the mailCheck() method in the 
Employee class.

Here, at compile time, the compiler used mailCheck() in Employee to validate this statement. At run time, however, the JVM invokes mailCheck() in the Salary class.

This behavior is referred to as virtual method invocation, and these methods are referred to as virtual methods. An overridden method is invoked at run time, 
no matter what data type the reference is that was used in the source code at compile time.

Example

public interface Vegetarian{}
public class Animal{}
public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian{}
Now, the Deer class is considered to be polymorphic since this has multiple inheritance. Following are true for the above examples −

A Deer IS-A Animal
A Deer IS-A Vegetarian
A Deer IS-A Deer
A Deer IS-A Object
When we apply the reference variable facts to a Deer object reference, the following declarations are legal −

Example
Deer d = new Deer();
Animal a = d;
Vegetarian v = d;
Object o = d;
All the reference variables d, a, v, o refer to the same Deer object in the heap.
